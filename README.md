# vstudio2022installer

Visual Studio 2022 Installer, since the bootstrap application Msoft provides keeps crashing on many systems. Just extract and run setup and pick the stuff you want. You can use [7zip]([url](http://www.e7z.org/)) or another program to extract it.
For those who want  to help do the same for other versions, run the Msoft setup and it'll create a folder called installer in Program files/visual studio, just compress said folder and upload. If yoou're wireshark savvy, maybe you can grab the download link where the setup pulls this from too.
